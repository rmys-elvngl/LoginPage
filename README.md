# LoginPage

It is aimed to create a login page project in which gulp, eslint and prettier structures are used and the codes in the project are unit tested. The project includes a registration page. If the user enters his information and clicks on the login button, he is automatically directed to the home page. However, if he tries to click on the button without entering his information, the guard structure is activated and the user cannot access other pages.

The project was created with Angular framework.
